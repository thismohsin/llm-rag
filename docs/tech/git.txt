Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code.
The most common Git workflow includes the following commands:

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository
- `git clone`: Copy a repository from remote to local machine
- `git add`: Stage changes for commit
- `git commit`: Save changes to local repository
- `git push`: Upload local commits to remote repository
- `git pull`: Download changes from remote repository

Branching is a key Git feature:
- `git branch`: List, create, or delete branches
- `git checkout`: Switch between branches
- `git merge`: Combine changes from different branches

To resolve merge conflicts, edit the conflicted files, add them, and then commit.
Git stash allows you to temporarily store uncommitted changes when you need to switch contexts.
