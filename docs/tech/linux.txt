Linux provides powerful command-line tools for system administration and development.
Common commands include 'ls' to list files, 'cd' to change directories, and 'mkdir' to create folders.
Permissions can be modified using the 'chmod' command, with options for read (r), write (w), and execute (x).
Process management is handled via commands like 'ps', 'top', and 'kill'.
The pipe operator '|' allows chaining commands together by passing output from one command as input to another.
Package management varies by distribution: 'apt' for Ubuntu/Debian, 'yum'/'dnf' for RedHat/CentOS, and 'pacman' for Arch Linux.
System logs are typically stored in the '/var/log/' directory and can be viewed with tools like 'less' or 'tail'.
